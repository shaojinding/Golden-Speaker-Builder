Do you like amusement parks? Well, I sure do. To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, a gigantic rollercoaster high above the ground. We had been at the park all day before I saw the Caterpillar. When I saw how high it rose into the air, I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I finally made it to the front where I gave the man my ticket, and jumped on the rollercoaster. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went straight up,  SO high I could see the sky above and the parking lot beneath. Boy was I THRILLED! I also thought, “Maybe this wasn’t a good idea after all.” Other people screamed constantly as we swiftly zoomed and twisted, fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. Unfortunately, as quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. I wanted to go again, but it was late and we had to drive home. That night I dreamed of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. That was my MOST memorable moment ever! I can’t wait to go again.
